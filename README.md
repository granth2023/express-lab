# Intro

It‚Äôs been a long day, and you‚Äôve covered a lot of ground.

It‚Äôs natural and **expected** for you to feel uncomfortable and confused by Node.js & Express at this point.

# Exercise

The goal of the exercise is to put in a rep doing everything that you did during the [Intro to Express](https://www.notion.so/Intro-to-Express-d8fc443dea4f418cb34dfd1382e0a3a5?pvs=21) lesson!
