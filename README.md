# Intro

It’s been a long day, and you’ve covered a lot of ground.

It’s natural and **expected** for you to feel uncomfortable and confused by Node.js & Express at this point.

As always, the journey toward competence requires practice - so let’s get on with it!


# Exercise

[Fork](https://git.generalassemb.ly/seb-beherenow/express-lab) this repo and clone it before you start working.

The goal of the exercise is to put in a rep doing everything that you did during the [Intro to Express](https://www.notion.so/d8fc443dea4f418cb34dfd1382e0a3a5?pvs=21) lesson!

Create a `students.json` and populate it with some dummy data, and add it to your project

Create a GET, POST, PUT and DELETE route.

GET /students

POST /students

PUT /student

DELETE /student

**************BONUS:************** Add HTTP Status codes to your responses!
